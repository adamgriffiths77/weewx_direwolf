# Description

This directory contains the files that are modified for Weewx to correctly obtain data from the weatherstation using RTL_433 and also export the data into the listed text files.

## Weewx.conf
- see the section of the configuration file under SDR for hte RTL_433 configuration and mapping of sensors
- see the section at the bottom of the configuration file for the APRS configuration which specifies the output directory and comments which is appended to the APRS packet for station description (helps people if they need to contact me if my station is doing something weird)
